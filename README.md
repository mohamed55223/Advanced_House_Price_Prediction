‚≠êÔ∏è ReadMe - Advanced House Prediction using Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor Models in Machine Learning ‚≠êÔ∏è

Introduction:
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques, specifically Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression models. The data used for training and testing the models is sourced from a real estate dataset comprising various features such as house area, number of bedrooms, location, etc.

Dependencies:
1. Python 3.x
2. Scikit-learn library (for machine learning algorithms)
3. Pandas library (for data manipulation and analysis)
4. NumPy library (for numerical computations)
5. Matplotlib library (for data visualization)
6. Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

Files Included:
1. `data.csv` - the dataset used for training and testing the models.
2. `Advanced_House_Prediction.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook file containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
3. `README.md` - this file providing an overview of the project.

Instructions:
1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that all the required dependencies are installed.
3. Open the `Advanced_House_Prediction.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE.
4. Run the code cells in sequential order to execute the project pipeline.
5. Explore and modify the code as per your requirements and experimentation goals.
6. Feel free to refer to the inline comments and documentation provided within the notebook for better understanding.

Additional Notes:
1. The dataset used in this project is for demonstration purposes only. Consider substituting it with your own dataset for real-world applications.
2. Experiment with different hyperparameters of the models to achieve better performance.
3. You can refer to the official documentation of scikit-learn for a detailed understanding of the models and their implementation.
4. Feel free to reach out with any questions or suggestions!
